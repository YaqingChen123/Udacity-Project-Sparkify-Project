# Project Motivation
This project is my first data mining project for Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Program.
For all prospective Airbnb hosts in Seattle, I was interested in the following questions:
1. When are typically listings available?
2. What is the distribution of the listing price?
3. Can we predict the price of a new listing based on some of its attributes?
4. What factors make the most difference in terms of pricing?
5. Whatâ€™s the review score for each listing?

# File Descriptions
-sparkify.ipynb: Jincludes data preparation, analysis, visualization, and machine learning models for small dataset<br>
-The smaller version used for data exploration (128MB) is available under: s3n://udacity-dsnd/sparkify/mini_sparkify_event_data.json

# Results

# Acknowledgements
I'd like to thank Udacity team for the opportunity they provided me to work on the sparkify project, the data in this project mimic the data generated by actual music streaming companies, which is close to real world scenarios. The essential skills I learned from this project is a preparation to take my career to the next level.
